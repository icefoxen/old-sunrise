Hmmm.  Two versions of the language?  Simple, non-GC SongLight, and heavy, GC
Song?  The memory model would either be the same, or quite similar --passing
objects from one to the other and back should be trivial.  Biggest issues for
that:
GC
Typing
Unicode strings (because SL would need to have them too)
Tagged structures
Module system
Typeclasses?


Exact references: References are laid out differently from non-refs, for
instance they always are set first in a record or stack.
Tagged blocks/arrays a la OCaml?  The only thing is, this can interfere with
anything that has to worry about memory layout... well, so can the previous,
really.
CHECK M3 RUNTIME MODEL!!!  And Eiffel!!!
Basically, if you're using GC, you can't PRECISELY control the memory
representation of, well, anything really.

...hmm.  Ideally, SongLight should be a DIRECT subset of Song, so you can port
things with just a recompile.  That's probably the easiest method of FFI.  But
they don't share a runtime, which is sorta inconvenient.  It can be worked
around though.
Basically, you want to be able to write Song's GC in SongLight.  Functions
being inter-operable is easy, and... hmm, come to think of it, reworking
structures and arrays would probably just be a matter of adding or stripping a
few words of metadata.  So, doable.

Well, unless you use exact references...  then you have to re-order
everything!
The thing is, how much does this memory-layout stuff matter to low-level
programming?  Does it really matter THAT much if a structure's pointers are
compacted to the front or something?  I mean, it means you can't use it to
directly set up an interrupt table, but such things aren't really THAT much
harder in assembly.

In the same vein, should there be a "direct" type to augment the implicit
usage of references?
(struct list
   (car:int 0)
   (cdr:list NIL))

This creates 2 memory cells: an int, and a pointer to a list.  The pointer is
hidden behind the implicit reference; all compound types (structs, arrays,
etc) are implicit references, just like Java.  So if it's:
(struct foo
   (a:int 0)
   (b:#int [10,20,30]))
This creates 2 cells also: an int, and a pointer to an int array.  Likewise,
an array of foo's would be an array of pointers to foo's.  Do I need some way
to write 
(struct foo
   (a:int 0)
   (b:@#int [10,20,30]))
and have b be a direct array?
Maybe.  Complexity vs. flexibility vs. convenience.  Aargh.  The problem here
is that foo's size is FIXED.  You cannot pull out that 3-element array and
stick a 6-element array in instead.  Which means the compiler has to worry
about how long the array is, and so on...

GRR.  Lots of complexity for dubious return.  Leave it, for now.









Okay.  I want a clear, consistant set of rules that let me tell how and when
types should be implicitly expanded from a less-general to a more-general
type.  Shortly, how to let me pass an int8 to something that expects an int16.
This should be done implicitly, and there should be explicit options to turn
an int16 into an int8.  It would be nice if the solution could be generalized
so I could use a range 1-10 where a range 0-20 is expected...
So, my options:
*Just make integers and floats Special, and let them be implictly converted,
foo8 -> foo16 -> foo32 -> foo64.
--Relatively simple, but requires some nasty, context-sensitive analysis of
integer literals
!!!  Use of archsize may help here!!
*Just have two types, int and uint, like Modula-2.  Byte can be seperate.
--Very very simple.  So simple it's very very attractive.  Just one problem.
What if you want a fucking int16 or int64?
*Let you specify various int-types of different bitsize and sign.
--Very flexible.  Too flexible.  Too complicated.  Kinda silly.

Signed vs unsigned is another issue.  Basically there are a few options... 
*A uint8 can be an int16, a uint16 can be an int32, and so on
--Guarentees no lossage, but is unwieldy and annoying and confusing
*All uint-to-int and vice-versa needs a typecast statement
--Makes sure the programmer notices, but can allow lossage.  Probably the best
choice, since freedom to the programmer is good.

Okay, here's another problem:
(type foo :int)
(def bop (a :foo)
  ...)
(bop 10)

10 is an int, or an int variant, or so on.  But bop takes an arg of type :foo.
One cannot be the other.

...I'm tempted to just say fuckit and say Bliss and Forth have the right
answers.  I'm sick of this strong-typing shit, but I'm not sure how to replace
it.  Maybe I should look at D and Modula more...


Gah.  This is simple.  Make some facility to cast types.
(type foo :int)
(def bop (a :foo)
  ...)
(bop (force :foo 10))

Forbid casting types to pointers, a la
(force :^:int 10)
Or possibly allow it, and have the compiler print a warning along the lines of
"either you know exactly what you're doing, or you don't have a clue".
Eh, forbid it, and then have an "address" type in the next revision maybe.

Numbers can be forced from one type to another.  At the moment they MUST be
cast, though later on some implicit coercion may end up happening.
Structures, arrays, and pointers may not be forced.  Other atomic values such
as bools and chars can.  Appropriate conversion should be done where possible,
such as sign extension and conversion of ints to floats and vice-versa.

There.  Life is suddenly simple and safe.
